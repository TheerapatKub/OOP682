# week9

This folder contains small OOP examples and utilities for week 9.

Structure:

- models/ - data models used by examples
  - __init__.py - exports main model classes
  - person.py, student.py, staff.py, classroom.py, bank_account.py
- app2.py - simple people manager CLI + tests
- app3.py - classroom demo script
- Inheritance.py - inheritance demo (for study)
- main.py - small Dog demo

Notes:
- Module files use lowercase names and `models` is a package to keep imports stable.
